            <div class="skillText"><h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>Attention to details combined with an expanding toolkit supports my approach to user research. 
                Proto-personas, personas, storyboarding, user journey maps, affinity diagrams, empathy maps, user interviews, user testing, 5 whys, 
                and open ended questions are some strategies I find helpful.  </p>

                <p>Familiarity with HIG and Material Design, style guides, and designing for accessibility are key elements in my design process.
                I am also proficient at freehand sketching, creating wireframes, prototypes, userflows, redlining, and heuristic analysis.</p>

                    <p>Being a solid team member is super important to me and so being code conversational is one of my priorities. 
                     I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code. I make it a habit to keep learning new tools.</p>

                <h4>Federal Trade Commission website redesign</h4>
                <p>For this project, I worked independently to redesign the FTC's website for desktop and mobile. 
                I performed user testing, redlining, heuristic evaluation, analyzed for accessibility, and developed 
                wireframes, low and high fidelity prototypes while maintaining a sense of the original branding tone.

                <h4> Play it Forward nonprofit redesign</h4>
                <p>With a team of fellow designers, I created a design update for pifmusic.org, a non-profit in the arts.
                    My primary roles were in supporting design, creating a style guide, communicating with the client,
                    wireframe creation, and presentation.

                <h4> Fuzzy Connect mobile app design</h4>
                <p>Creating a mobile app prototype with a team of designers.  Fuzzy Connect was conceptualized in response to an overwhelmingly atomized society that makes it hard for people to connect for professional or academic mentorship and research.<br>
                I played a substantial part in the user research, interactive design, wireframes, and user testing. Project duration was 3 weeks.         </p>

                <h4> Trip Weaver mobile app design</h4>
                <p> Over a course of 3 weeks, I independently conducted user interviews, conceptualized an app based on user goals, and created a basic interactive mobile prototype.
                <br> The purpose of this app is to support travelers in a post-Covid 19 world.
